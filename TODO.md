# WhileUI TODO

## Pending

### Phase 3: Core Improvements (Non-breaking)

- [ ] **Skeleton shimmer variant** (optional): Add shimmer sweep in addition to pulsing

### Phase 4: New Primitives (As needed)

- [ ] Chart primitives (BarChart, HorizontalMetricChart) with theme tokens
- [ ] Generic Sheet/Modal block
- [ ] SearchBar, DatePicker improvements

---

## Reference

- **Blocks strategy**: Primitives + generic blocks (EmptyState, ErrorState, LoadingScreen, ContentSkeleton) in core; auth/profile as copy-paste templates in showcase
