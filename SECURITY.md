# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/whileloophq/whileui/security/advisories/new)** (preferred), or
2. **Create a private security issue** and we’ll respond as soon as we can.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
